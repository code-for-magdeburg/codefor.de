Welcome to the Bielefeld OK Lab! 

We are a group of enthusiasts interested in hardware/software development, design and open data.
Together we create digital tools and visualisations to make open data visible and usable for the wider public.

Everyone interested is invited to come along and join in!

Become a member of our MeetUp-group to receive the latest information about our events and meetings.
